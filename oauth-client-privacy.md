# Privacy Policy (OAuth Client – Google Drive AppData)

## Introduction
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how data is handled when you sign in with Google and allow our OAuth client to access your **Google Drive AppData**.  
This document is **separate** from the extension-wide privacy policy.

## Data We Collect
This OAuth client stores and reads app-specific data **only** in your Google Drive **AppData** area.  
No personal data is transmitted to our own servers or third parties.


### Data Stored in Google Drive AppData
- **(Default) Favorites data**: Stored/synced **only if you turn on “Favorites sync.”** This includes favorite items and related metadata.
- **(Optional) Other app-specific data**: To improve usability and backup quality, additional app-specific data (e.g., settings, cached or summarized data) **may be added in the future as opt-in features**. Such data will be stored **only within the scope you enable**, and any material changes will be announced via updates to this document and/or in-app notices.

> We do **not** access your regular “My Drive” files or any other user’s files.  
> AppData is an application-specific, hidden area in your Google Drive.

### Permissions Used
- **Google OAuth Scope**: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata`  
  Used solely to create, read, update, and delete files in your AppData folder.

## Data Usage
- The collected data is used **only** to provide backup/sync features for the extension.
- We do **not** sell, share, or transmit your data to external servers or third parties.

## Data Security
- All communications occur over **HTTPS (TLS)**.
- OAuth access tokens are handled securely by the browser/runtime and are **not** logged or stored on our servers.
- We follow the **Google API Services User Data Policy (including Limited Use)**.

## User Consent
By signing in with Google and granting the scope above, you consent to the processing described in this policy.  
You can revoke access anytime in **Google Account → Security → Third-party access**.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here; continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
