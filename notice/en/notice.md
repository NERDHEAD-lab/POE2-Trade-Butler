## Notice

### A major update (3.0.0) with many changes has been released!

Accessibility and usability for several features have been improved.
```
A convenience toolbar has been added beneath the existing sidebar collapse/expand toggle.
Announcements/notices can now be viewed.
The preview feature—intended to quickly review search criteria—could sometimes be distracting. It can now be disabled. The option is available in Settings and is also accessible from the toolbar.
An "Add to Favorites" button has been added to the toolbar.
```

Because the Chrome Extension’s account storage is limited to 100 KB by default, the Favorites feature can be constrained.
```
An option to switch to "Google Drive" is available.
Location: Settings → Performance.
```

## Roadmap (Next Update)

- Saving of the expanded/collapsed state of the Favorites list is planned. (3.1.0)
- A feature to share favorites is under development; simple link- or value-based sharing is being considered. (3.2.0)
